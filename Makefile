# note that make will always retranslate all needed .java files,
# but that's OK since translation for this program is quick.
# (That assumes no junk .java files in this directory.)
# (That's unlike using make for C++ where one usually specifies dependencies;
#  we won't bother trying since translation is quick.)
#
# (be sure to put class X in file X.java)

# the -Xlint checks for a bunch of bad things.
# must use -Xlint; mustn't have any warnings.
# except for the provided Main.java (which has some redundant casts)

# if you have non-standard ls or grep, you'll need to give pathnames:
## NotMainJava = `/bin/ls -1 *.java | /bin/grep -v -w Main.java`
NotMainJava = `ls -1 *.java | grep -v -w Main.java`

# instead of "echo" below, could instead use here
#    NotMainJava := $(shell /bin/ls -1 *.java | /bin/grep -v -w Main.java)
# but that mightn't be supported by all makes.
